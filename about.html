          <p>
          Born and raised in Maryland, I am happy to call Baltimore home. I stayed local for college and attended the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in both Visual Arts and Media Communications. When I first arrived at UMBC, I was initially interested in animation with the desire to enter the video game design field. I later developed a strong interest in graphic design finding the love of typography, color theory, and attention to the fine details. I have always had a great interest in sports and had the honor of playing varsity lacrosse during my time at UMBC. It was a great four year experience. Our team won three American East Championships and made four trips to the NCAA Tournament. After graduating, I was fortunate enough to travel with the team to Japan. This was the first of my many international adventures.

      <h2>My early professional career</h2>      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col col-md-8">
          <p>My professional career began as a web designer with a small branding agency in Ellicott City, Maryland called Galley Creative Group. Here I was able to fine-tune my skills establishing strong web presences for clients. Early in my career, I was able to work comprehensively with several powerful content management systems, including Magento, Drupal, Joomla and WordPress. My early interaction with these open-source platforms inspired me to learn more and expand my development knowledge.</p>
          
          <p>In 2011, I made the transition to Unleashed Technologies. Working with the talented team at Unleashed Technologies helped me grow as a professional and fine tune my skills. My focus during my time there involved design and development for Drupal and Magento projects, but there have been WordPress and Symphony projects mixed in as well. I spent nearly a decade at Unleashed and was promoted to Creative Director, where I lead and managed all design initiatives for our clients.

        <div class="col col-md-8">
          <p>I made the transition to Phase2 in 2021 and that decision has been extremely valuable to my career. I have been able to work with several prominent companies and brands while also having the privilege of collaborating with a strong team of strategists, copywriters, UX researchers, and data experts. I am currently the Director of Design where I manage the agency creative process, workflow, visual design and creative output. I am an advocate for Figma best practices, design systems, and sustainable design.
          </p>
          <p>I have had the privilege to represent Phase2 at DrupalCon in 2022 and 2024 as a speaker. Watch the <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/PRcUeeCRhpo?si=dXdLpjxzL8krT8Q4" target="_blank">recording of my 2022 DrupalCon talk, "Designing Drupal Experiences with Figma"</a>!</p>
