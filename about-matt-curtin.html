            <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Maryland, I am happy to call Baltimore home. I stayed local for college and attended the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in both Visual Arts and Media Communications. When I first arrived at UMBC, I was initially interested in Animation, but later developed a strong interest in Graphic Design and made that my primary focus. I have always had a great interest in sports and had the honor of playing varsity lacrosse at UMBC. It was a great four year experience â€” the team won three American East Championships and made four trips to the NCAA Tournament.</p>

            <h2>My Professional Career</h2>
            <p>My professional career began as a web designer with a small branding agency in Ellicott City, Maryland called Galley Creative Group. Here I was able to fine-tuned my skills establishing strong web presences for clients. Early in my career, I was able to work comprehensively with several powerful content management systems, including Magento, Drupal, Joomla and WordPress. My early interraction with these open-source platforms inspired me to learn more and expand my development knowledge.</p>
            <p>In 2011, I made the transition to Unleashed Technologies. At Unleashed I have continued to expand my skillset and have worked on some really exicting projects. Working with the talented team at Unleashed Technologies has helped me grow as a professional and fine tune my skills. My focus over the past 8+ years has been design and development for Drupal and Magento projects, but there have been WordPress and Symphony projects mixed in as well. </p>
